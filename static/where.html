        <!-- Where was data obtained from-->
        <p>The data explored in this project comes from two separate sources:</p> 
        <p>-Firstly, a highly detailed csv file from Kaggle was accessed in which data covered
            over 5 million used and new car listings within the state of Illinois from June 2018 to June 2020.
            The data used from this source was used to provide general comparitive reference to the data analyzed from our second source.
        </p>
        <p>-Secondly, a web-scraping algorithm was designed to retrieve data on new car listings from Cargurus.com. The scraped
            data was restricted to four selected zip codes and each of their corresponding areas within a 50 mile radius. The four zip codes were selected to cover the four main
            metroplexes within the state of Texas: 76012 (DFW Metroplex), 78234 (Austin Metroplex), 77033 (Houston Metroplex), and 78234 (San Antonio Metroplex).
            From then, the data was filtered to only reflect the 2022 Ford Maverick, 2022 Ford Bronco,
            2022 General Motors (GMC) Hummer , 2022 General Motors (Chevrolet) Blazer, 2022 Toyota Tundra, and the 2022 Jeep Wrangler.
        </p>

            It is important to highlight that the scraped data from the Cargurus.com portion of our dataset comes from a specific moment in time.
            The web-scraping was conducted on Wednesday July 6th between 8pm-11pm and strictly represents what was present on Cargurus.com during that time-frame.
